# BookSearch

A flutter medium series where I gradually build a bookshelf app.

## If you are looking for the code of a post, I created a branch which contains the code of the post. More information below.

## What's the app going to be?

The app will let you collect Stamps of your already read book. Gradually building up your stamp collection while reading your favorite books!

## Is there a way to make this even cooler?

Great that you ask! Yes there is!
To showcase a vast amout of possibilities I will implement different UIs for the app, to top it all of, you as a user will be able to switch UI while being in the app.

### Sounds cool? Leave a star so others can also find this project!
